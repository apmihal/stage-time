# Stage Time

Stage Time is a website that makes it easy for comedy show hosts to manage their shows and the performers that are on them. It allows for the creation of individual shows with a list of performers that can easily be rearranged at any time to suit the needs of the show.

It's written in Java using the Spring Boot framework with Thymeleaf templates, and MySQL for data management.
